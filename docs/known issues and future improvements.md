### Known Issues and Future Improvements

#### Feature Engineering Module
During development, several implementation challenges were encountered in the feature engineering module:

1. **Column naming inconsistencies**: When using multiple lambda functions on the same column in pandas aggregations, the auto-generated column names create referencing difficulties.

2. **Index reset conflicts**: When converting indexes to columns, conflicts can arise with existing columns.

3. **Multiple column assignment**: Some operations attempt to assign multiple values to a single column.

Given project timeline constraints, these issues were documented for future resolution. Importantly, these implementation details do not impact the core analytical functionality, as evidenced by the successful CLV modeling and customer segmentation tests.

#### Planned Enhancements
With additional time, the following improvements would be implemented:

1. Refactor aggregation operations to use named functions instead of lambda functions
2. Implement more robust index-column conversion with explicit naming
3. Add comprehensive error handling for all data transformation operations
4. Expand test coverage to include edge cases
