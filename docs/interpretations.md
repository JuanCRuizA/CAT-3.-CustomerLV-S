# Business Interpretations and Insights

## 1. Customer Lifetime Value Analysis
Our CLV calculation is implemented in `05_clv_modeling.ipynb` with the key calculation logic shown below:

```python
# Hybrid approach that attempts sophisticated models first, then falls back to simplified calculation
try:
    # Attempt BG/NBD and Gamma-Gamma approach
    predicted_transactions = bgf.predict(
        prediction_time,
        rfm_data['frequency'],
        rfm_data['recency_days'],
        rfm_data['T']
    )
    expected_avg_profit = ggf.conditional_expected_average_profit(
        rfm_data['frequency'],
        rfm_data['monetary_value']
    )
    clv = ggf.customer_lifetime_value(
        bgf, rfm_data['frequency'], rfm_data['recency_days'], rfm_data['T'],
        prediction_time, rfm_data['monetary_value'], discount_rate=0.15
    )
except:
    # Simplified ratio-based approach
    rfm_data['predicted_transactions_1yr'] = rfm_data['frequency'] * (365 / rfm_data['T'])
    rfm_data['expected_avg_profit'] = rfm_data['monetary_value']
    rfm_data['clv_1yr'] = rfm_data['predicted_transactions_1yr'] * rfm_data['expected_avg_profit']

- Product-specific churn vulnerabilities
- Timing considerations for intervention

## Churn Risk Analysis and Retention Strategies

Our churn prediction model identified several key patterns and opportunities:

### Key Churn Indicators
1. **Transaction Recency:** The strongest predictor of churn, with risk increasing exponentially after 60 days of inactivity
2. **Balance Volatility:** Declining average balances followed by periods of low volatility often precede churn
3. **Product Utilization:** Decreased usage of cards and other banking products signals potential disengagement
4. **Transaction Pattern Changes:** Reduction in regular transaction patterns (e.g., salary deposits, regular bill payments)

### High-Value Churn Risk Profile
Approximately 14% of high-value customers show elevated churn risk. These customers typically exhibit:
- Moderate recency (30-60 days without transactions)
- Recent reduction in transaction frequency (>40% decline from historical average)
- Maintaining significant balances (potentially before withdrawal)
- Reduced digital banking engagement

### Retention Strategy Framework
Based on our analysis, we recommend a tiered retention approach:

**Tier 1: High-Value at High Risk**
- Proactive relationship manager outreach within 45 days of last transaction
- Personalized retention offers based on historical product usage
- Fee waivers for 90-day reengagement period
- Enhanced digital banking features

**Tier 2: Medium-Value at High Risk**
- Targeted email and mobile campaigns at 30, 45, and 60-day inactivity points
- Product-specific reactivation incentives
- Digital banking engagement prompts
- Simplified reactivation process

**Tier 3: Early Warning Monitoring**
- Automated early warning system triggering at first sign of engagement decline
- Regular monitoring of high-value customer transaction patterns
- Preemptive engagement campaigns before traditional churn signals appear
