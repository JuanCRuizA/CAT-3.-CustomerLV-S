# Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Analysis and Customer Segmentation Project 

## Overview 
Machine learning project to analyse and estimate the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) and propose Customer Segmentation using historical banking data from a Czech financial dataset. 

## Project Structure 
`src/`: Source code for data preprocessing and model development 
`data/`: Dataset documentation and information 
`docs/`: Project documentation 
`tests/`: Unit tests 

## Features
1.	Customer segmentation - The process of dividing customers into distinct groups based on shared characteristics
2.	Churn prediction - Using machine learning to identify customers likely to leave the bank. 
3.	Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) - A prediction of the total value a customer will bring to the bank over their entire relationship. 
4.	Cross-selling - Using data analytics to identify which additional products to offer existing customers. 
5.	Propensity modeling - Building predictive models to calculate how likely a customer is to: Buy specific products, respond to marketing campaigns, use certain banking channels or become a high-value customer
6.	Customer journey - Analyzing the entire sequence of interactions between a customer and the bank.
